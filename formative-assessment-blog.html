      <h1>Making Learning Visible: How I Use Formative Assessment in My Classroom</h1>
      <p><strong>Gracielle Oliveira Mota Dias</strong> — IB Computer Science & Design Innovation Teacher, Pan American School of Bahia</p>
      <p>Formative assessment has become one of the most powerful parts of my teaching practice. I see it not only as a way to check understanding but also as a tool to make thinking visible—for both students and for me as their teacher. It transforms the classroom into a space where learning is dynamic, collaborative, and full of discovery.</p>

        <h2>The “Sandwich Algorithm”</h2>
        <p>To explore algorithmic thinking, I divided students into two groups and gave them real sandwich ingredients. Each group had to write step-by-step instructions for assembling a sandwich, as if they were writing a program. Then, the groups swapped “code” and followed each other’s instructions exactly.</p>
        <p>The results were hilarious—and insightful. Students quickly realized that missing a single step or misusing a word could completely alter the outcome. This simple exercise made the logic of algorithms tangible and fun.</p>
        <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Students were highly engaged, creative, and collaborative.<br>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> Some needed extra guidance turning natural language into structured steps.</p>

        <h2>The “Real-Life Maze Challenge”</h2>
        <p>Another formative activity I love is the “Real-Life Maze Challenge.” I built a physical maze in the classroom using tape and desks, dividing students into teams with roles: <strong>Programmer</strong>, <strong>Debugger</strong>, and <strong>Executor</strong>. Together, they had to create and test a sequence of commands to navigate the maze successfully.</p>
        <p>Watching them test, fail, and debug was incredible. The laughter and focus filled the room, and behind it all was deep learning about iteration, collaboration, and perseverance.</p>
        <p><strong>What worked:</strong> The activity built teamwork, logical reasoning, and resilience.<br>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> It required time and flexibility to manage different group paces.</p>

      <h2>Reflection: What Worked and What Was Challenging</h2>
      <p>Both activities turned abstract ideas into experiences. Students didn’t just learn algorithms—they felt them. The simplicity, humor, and collaboration made the learning process stick.</p>
      <p>Of course, these lessons also required careful setup and timing. But that’s what makes them powerful: they show that learning takes planning, flexibility, and reflection from both teacher and students.</p>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>Formative assessment, to me, is a living dialogue. It celebrates curiosity and learning in motion. When students are encouraged to test, fail, and try again, they grow as problem-solvers and collaborators. Every mistake becomes a visible sign of growth—and that’s what makes learning truly meaningful.</p>
