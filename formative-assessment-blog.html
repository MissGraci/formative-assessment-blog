        <h1>Making Learning Visible: How I Use Formative Assessment in My Classroom</h1>
        <p>Exploring how formative assessment turns thinking into something we can see, discuss, and improve together.</p>
      </div>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>Formative assessment is one of the most powerful ways I connect students‚Äô thinking with their learning process. It helps me understand not just what they know, but *how* they think. More importantly, it gives students ownership of their progress, turning each mistake into an opportunity to learn and improve.</p>

      <p>Over time, I‚Äôve learned that formative assessment doesn‚Äôt have to mean quizzes or checklists ‚Äî it can be playful, creative, and hands-on. Below are two of my favorite examples that bring computational thinking to life in my classroom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ü•™ The ‚ÄúSandwich Algorithm‚Äù</h2>
      <p>To explore algorithmic thinking, I divided students into two groups and brought real sandwich ingredients to class. Each team had to write step-by-step instructions describing how to make a sandwich ‚Äî as if they were programming a robot. Then, they swapped instructions and tried to build the other team‚Äôs sandwich *exactly* as written.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-000000008b80622f87e678394f834fa4" alt="Didactic illustration of students creating sandwich algorithms">
        <figcaption>Students discovered how clarity, sequencing, and precision shape the outcome of a program.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The results were hilarious ‚Äî some sandwiches were missing ingredients or completely reversed! But beyond the fun, students grasped that **ambiguity creates bugs**. They saw how computers interpret instructions literally and how every step in an algorithm must be clear and ordered.</p>

      <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Students showed high engagement, teamwork, and creativity.<br>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> Translating everyday language into logical code-like structures took time and support.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üåÄ The ‚ÄúReal-Life Maze Challenge‚Äù</h2>
      <p>In another lesson, I transformed the classroom into a giant maze made of desks and tape on the floor. Students worked in teams with three defined roles: **Programmer**, **Debugger**, and **Executor**. Together, they had to design a sequence of commands to guide their teammate safely through the maze.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-00000000a288622f92052306d543e019" alt="Didactic illustration of maze challenge in a classroom">
        <figcaption>Collaboration and debugging came to life as students guided each other through the maze.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Watching the teams plan, test, fail, and try again was incredible. They celebrated small wins and quickly learned to view errors as feedback. The atmosphere was filled with laughter, focus, and problem-solving energy ‚Äî the essence of computational thinking.</p>

      <p><strong>What worked:</strong> The activity promoted perseverance, communication, and logical reasoning.<br>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> Setting up the maze required preparation and managing different paces demanded flexibility.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üå± Reflection: What Works and What‚Äôs Challenging</h2>
      <p>Both activities transformed abstract programming concepts into memorable experiences. Students didn‚Äôt just learn algorithms ‚Äî they *lived* them. The success of these lessons lies in their simplicity and emotional engagement: they allow students to feel the logic rather than memorize it.</p>

      <p>Still, these lessons require planning, time, and space. Not every class can unfold perfectly, but every attempt offers valuable insight. I‚Äôve learned to embrace unpredictability as part of the process ‚Äî after all, iteration is at the heart of both learning and programming.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>‚ú® Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>For me, formative assessment is a continuous dialogue ‚Äî a way to make learning visible, tangible, and meaningful. When students are invited to test, fail, and reflect, they grow as thinkers and collaborators. These small, playful moments often reveal the biggest breakthroughs.</p>
