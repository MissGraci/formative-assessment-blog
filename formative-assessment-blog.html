        <h1>Making Learning Visible: How I Use Formative Assessment in My Classroom</h1>
        <p>Exploring how formative assessment turns thinking into something we can see, discuss, and refine.</p>
      </div>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>Formative assessment is one of the most powerful ways I connect students’ thinking with their learning process. It helps me understand not just what they know, but <em>how</em> they think. Importantly, it gives students ownership over their growth and turns every error into a chance to reflect and refine.</p>
      <p>Over time, I’ve realized that formative assessment doesn’t need to be quizzes or worksheets — it can be playful, embodied, and deeply meaningful. The two activities below show how students can <em>live</em> computational thinking in class.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The “Sandwich Algorithm”</h2>
      <p>I divided students into two groups and brought real sandwich ingredients to class. Each group wrote a precise, step-by-step “algorithm” for assembling a sandwich. Then they swapped instructions and tried to build the other team’s sandwich <em>exactly</em> as written.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/sandwich Oct 14, 2025, 11_49_50 PM.png" alt="Students learning algorithmic thinking with a sandwich activity">
        <figcaption>Students experienced how precision and clarity impact algorithmic outcomes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The results were playful and illuminating — some sandwiches were mixed up, ingredients missing, or steps reversed. These “bugs” sparked discussion about how even a small omission or ambiguity can change an entire process.</p>
      <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Engagement soared, collaboration flourished, and students visibly improved their planning logic.<br>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> Many needed scaffolding to convert everyday language into structured, clear instructions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The “Real-Life Maze Challenge”</h2>
      <p>In another lesson, I transformed the classroom into a maze with desks and tape. Students worked in teams with three roles: <strong>Programmer</strong>, <strong>Debugger</strong>, and <strong>Executor</strong>. Together, they designed a command sequence to navigate the maze successfully.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Maze Oct 14, 2025, 11_51_33 PM.png" alt="Students programming a real-life maze challenge in class">
        <figcaption>Teams tested their command sequences in real space, iterating through failures.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Watching students plan, test, fail, and revise was inspiring. They began to see errors as feedback rather than failure. The atmosphere became collaborative, energetic, and focused.</p>
      <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Students developed perseverance, logic, and communication.<br>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> Maze setup was time-consuming, and balancing different team speeds demanded adaptive pacing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reflection: What Works & What’s Challenging</h2>
      <p>The magic of these activities lies in transformation — concepts become experiences. Students didn’t just learn algorithms; they <em>felt</em> them. Engagement, curiosity, and peer teaching surged.</p>
      <p>Yet, the challenges remain: preparation, timing, space constraints, and pacing. I embrace this complexity because it’s in the struggle that growth happens. Embracing iteration, renegotiating instructions, and opening space for error has deepened student ownership and reflection.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>To me, formative assessment is an ongoing dialogue — a living process that amplifies curiosity, creativity, and growth. When students are invited to test, fail, reflect, and try again, they step into the mindset of thinkers and collaborators. In this space, mistakes are stepping stones, and learning becomes visible in every moment.</p>
