      <h1>Making Learning Visible: How I Use Formative Assessment in My Classroom</h1>
      <p>Formative assessment turns thinking into something we can see, discuss, and improve together. Below are two hands-on activities that help my students connect algorithms to real-world action.</p>

        <h2>The “Sandwich Algorithm”</h2>
        <p>To explore algorithmic thinking, I divided students into two groups and brought real sandwich ingredients to class. Each group had to write a precise, step-by-step “algorithm” describing how to make a sandwich. Then, the teams swapped their instructions and had to follow them exactly to assemble the other group’s sandwich.</p>
        <p>The results were full of laughter—and a few “buggy” sandwiches—but also deep insights into how clarity and precision are essential in programming. Students quickly realized that missing a single instruction or misplacing a step could completely change the outcome.</p>
        <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Students were highly engaged and demonstrated strong collaboration and creativity.<br>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> Some groups needed extra support translating their natural language into logical sequences.</p>

        <h2>The “Real-Life Maze Challenge”</h2>
        <p>Another favorite formative assessment is the “Real-Life Maze Challenge.” I built a maze in the classroom and divided students into teams. Each member played a specific role: <strong>Programmer</strong> (writes commands), <strong>Debugger</strong> (checks and corrects errors), and <strong>Executor</strong> (follows instructions).</p>
        <p>Teams had to create a sequence of commands to help the Executor navigate the maze successfully. Watching them plan, test, fail, and retry was inspiring—the activity made debugging and iteration feel natural and fun.</p>
        <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Students developed perseverance, communication, and logical reasoning.<br>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> Setting up the maze took time, and managing different team speeds required flexibility.</p>

      <h2>What Worked and What Was Challenging</h2>
      <p><strong>What Worked:</strong> Students were deeply engaged and retained concepts longer through experiential learning. Collaboration became natural, and the atmosphere in the classroom was filled with curiosity and joy.</p>
      <p><strong>What Was Challenging:</strong> These activities require preparation and space, and managing varied learning paces can be tricky. However, the outcomes always justify the effort—students demonstrate true understanding, not memorization.</p>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>For me, formative assessment is a continuous dialogue—a living process that celebrates curiosity, creativity, and growth. Every mistake becomes an opportunity to reflect and refine. When students see learning as an iterative journey, they begin to value not just the result but the process itself.</p>
